# MoodsAndMirrors
De Anza iOS Design Class Final Project

Tableview for questions does not work at the moment. 
Specifically, moving to detail view from the cell causes a crash.

Currently, tracking of user responses from detail view is not implemented. 
Turns out graphing free-form text inputs on the fly is hard.

Crash on view load for graph tab if mood data is not entered prior to loading the graph tab.
